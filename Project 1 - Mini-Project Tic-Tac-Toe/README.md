## Objective
Build my own game from scratch. Put into practice the basic Python which Iâ€™ve learned on the first week of IronHack course.

### Game Choose
> TIC-TAC-TOE

## Game Instructions
**TIC-TAC-TOE** is uselly played on a piece of paper, but if you copy this code you can play it on your own laptop.
How it Works? Two players write either O or X in a pattern of nine squares. The first player who places three Os or three Xs in a straight line wins In this virtual version, it's YOU x CPU.
<br>Good luck!<br>

Copy the code of "TIC_TAC_TOE.ipynb" and paste it into your Python3 or JupyterNotebook, then it's only run it.

## Challenges
- Find the best format to display and enter data;
- Structure the winner's logic;
- Delimit the input of user coordinates;
- Remember the rules for work with global variables inside functions;

## New Learnings
- Styling the text displayed on jupyter notebook (apply colors, bold etc).

## Theory applied
[x] Lists (necessary to create the graph of game and to structure all the logic);
[x] Error Handling (to delimit inputs of user);
[x] Loops (while and for);
[x] Sub-functions (to organize and structure all code);
[x] Classes (to format the colors of data displayed);
