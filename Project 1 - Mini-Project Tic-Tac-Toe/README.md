## Objective
Build my own game from scratch. Put into practice the basic concepts of Python which Iâ€™ve learned on the first week of IronHack course.

### Game Choose
> TIC-TAC-TOE

## Game Instructions
**TIC-TAC-TOE** is uselly played on a piece of paper, but if you copy this code you can play it on your own laptop.<br>
### How to Play? 
Two players write either O or X in a pattern of nine squares. The first player who places three Os or three Xs in a straight line wins. <br>
In this virtual version, it's YOU x CPU.<br>

### Let's play?
To start, copy the code of "TIC_TAC_TOE.ipynb" and paste it into your Python3 or JupyterNotebook, then it's only run it.

## Challenges
- Find the best format to display and enter data;
- Structure the winner's logic;
- Delimit the input of user coordinates;
- Remember the rules for work with global variables inside functions;

## New Learnings
- Styling the text displayed on jupyter notebook (apply colors, bold etc).

## Theory applied
[x] Lists (necessary to create the graph of game and to structure all the logic);<br>
[x] Error Handling (to delimit inputs of user);<br>
[x] Loops (while and for);<br>
[x] Sub-functions (to organize and structure all code);<br>
[x] Classes (to format the colors of data displayed);<br>
 
## Improvement
- Build this game using pygame library.
