# Week 1 Mini-Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
## TIC-TAC-TOE

- Challenged:
TIC-TAC-TOE is uselly played on a piece of paper, but here you can play it on your own laptop.
How it Works? Two players write either O or X in a pattern of nine squares. The first player who places three Os or three Xs in a straight line wins.
In this virtual version, it's YOU x CPU.
Good luck!
How to play? Copy the code of "TIC_TAC_TOE.ipynb" on your Python3 or JupyterNotebook and run.

- Challenges:
- Find the best format to display and enter data;
- Structure the winner's logic;
- Delimit the input of user coordinates;
- Remember the rules for work with global variables inside functions; 

- Learnings:
Ways of styling the text displayed (colors, bold etc).

- Improvements:
Reproduce this game with pygames library.

-  Theory in practice:
[x] Lists (necessary to creathe the graph of game and to structure all the logic);
[x] Error Handling (to delimit inputs of user);
[x] Loops (while and for);
[x] Sub-functions (to organize and structure all code);
[x] Classes (to format the colors of data displayed);

practice the basic Python which
youâ€™ve learned this week
