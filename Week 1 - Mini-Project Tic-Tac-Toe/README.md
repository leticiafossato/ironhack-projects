# Week 1 Mini-Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
## TIC-TAC-TOE

TIC-TAC-TOE is uselly played on a piece of paper, but if you copy this code you can play it on your own laptop.<br />
How it Works? Two players write either O or X in a pattern of nine squares. The first player who places three Os or three Xs in a straight line wins.<br />
In this virtual version, it's YOU x CPU.<br />
Good luck!<br />
<b>How to play?</b> Copy the code of "TIC_TAC_TOE.ipynb" on your Python3 or JupyterNotebook and run.

<b>Challenges:</b>
- Find the best format to display and enter data;
- Structure the winner's logic;
- Delimit the input of user coordinates;
- Remember the rules for work with global variables inside functions; 

<b>Learnings:</b>
Ways of styling the text displayed (colors, bold etc).

<b>Improvements:</b>
Reproduce this game using pygames library.

<b>Theory in practice:</b>
[x] Lists (necessary to creathe the graph of game and to structure all the logic);<br />
[x] Error Handling (to delimit inputs of user);<br />
[x] Loops (while and for);<br />
[x] Sub-functions (to organize and structure all code);<br />
[x] Classes (to format the colors of data displayed);<br />
