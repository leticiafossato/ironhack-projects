### Specific Objective
The database that I chose to build refers to a game called Fortnite, the specific objective of my analysis it's to answer:
> What are Fortnite pro-players performance? 

## Motivation
On quarentine, I started to play Fortnite with my boyfriend and my friends.<br>
This motivated me to search about the best players of the game, and how many money they earns just playing.<br>
Also, I want to compare my account stats with pro-players.<br>

## Fortnite
It's a FPS Online Game.<br> 
To win a match, you need to be the last one to survive.<br>
Each match have 100 players. <br>

## Process
1. Use raw web-scraping to collect who are TOP 25 players best classified at Fortnite's World Cup 2019;<br>
2. Use an API to collect the data about TOP 25 players (It's not informations about the World Cup);<br>
<a href="https://dash.fortnite-api.com/">API Source <br></a>
3. Filter the players which profile it's privated or the data it's unavailable;<br>
4. Use the same API to collect my account data;<br>
5. Store the results on my own database;<br>
6. Analyze results on Tableau.<br>

## Learning Process
### Challenges
- Low public information about Fortnite to analyze;
- Choose only trustable players informations;
- Make the subject interesting for who doesn't play.
