## Objectives
This project it's composed by two parts:<br>
- Part01: Obtain data from different sources (using API and Web-Scraping) and store it in a database;<br>
- Part02: Build a data visualization using tableau.<br>

### Specific Objective
I decided to build a database about Fornite (game), to answer this "business" question:
> What are Fortnite pro-players performance? 

## Motivation
On quarentine, I started to play Fortnite with my boyfriend and my friends.<br>
This motivated me to search about the best players of the game, and how many money they earns just playing.<br>
Also, I want to compare my account stats with pro-players stats.<br>

## Fortnite
It's a FPS Online Game.<br> 
To win a match, you need to be the last one to survive.<br>
Each match have 100 players. <br>
You can shot and also construct to deffend yourself.<br>
The Game Have 4 Modes: Solo, Duo, Squad, Creative.<br> 
Here, will be analyzed only **Solo** informations:<br> 
- Solo Matches; <br> 
- Solo Minutes Played; <br> 
- Solo Kills / Match; <br> 
- Solo Kills / Minutes; <br>

## Process
1. Use raw web-scraping to collect who are TOP 25 players best classified at Fortnite's World Cup 2019;<br>
2. Use an API to collect the data about TOP 25 players (It's not informations about the World Cup);<br>
<a href="https://dash.fortnite-api.com/">API Source <br></a>
3. Filter the players which profile it's privated or the data it's unavailable;<br>
4. Use the same API to collect my account data;<br>
5. Store the results on my own database;<br>
6. Analyze results on Tableau.<br>

## Learning Process
### Challenges
- Low public information about Fortnite to analyze;
- Choose only trustable players informations;
- Make the subject interesting for who doesn't play.

### New Learnings
- The greatest teaching I had is that we can create a database about anything we like, includding about a game.

### Theory applied
[x] API;<br>
[x] Web Scraping;<br>
[x] Data Visualization;<br>

### Improvements
- Improve the Tableau presentation;
