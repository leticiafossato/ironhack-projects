## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a model to predict prices of diamonds, practicing linear regression.

### Problem Statement
> The price predicted needs to have a root mean squared error lower than 900 dollars.

## Resources
Datasets was provided by IronHack. <br>
00-diamonds.csv<br>
00-rick_diamonds.csv<br>

## Process
- Import the dataframe;
- Create a first baseline predicting the price by the mean;
- Start to Explore and Clean the Data:
     - Check null values;
     - Search for outliers - comparing mean and median;
     - Calculate values to correct x,y and z;
     - Check correlations.
- Apply the linear regression to predict the prices of diamonds;
- Improve the model until RMSE (root mean squared error) < 900.

## Results
|    RÂ²   |  RMSE  |
|  -----  | -------|
| 95.38%  |    853 |
