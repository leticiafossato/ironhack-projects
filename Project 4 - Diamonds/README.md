## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a model to predict prices of diamonds, practicing linear regression.

### Problem Statement
> The price predicted needs to have a root mean squared error lower than 900 dollars.

## Resources
Datasets was provided by IronHack. <br>
00-diamonds.csv<br>
00-rick_diamonds.csv<br>

## Process
- Import the dataframe;
- Create a first baseline predicting the price using the mean;
- Start to Explore and Clean the Data;
